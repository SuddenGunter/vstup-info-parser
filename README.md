# vstup-info-parser
Parser for http://vstup.info/ 

Can be executed using run.sh (see that file - you must provide a link to parse there).
Created for about 2 nights of quick coding in 2018 for private research purposes only.
Only tested for Kharkivska Obl, only for 2017 and 2018 years (I needed only that data).

Now abandoned, uploaded in 2019 to github from bitbucket as a buckup
